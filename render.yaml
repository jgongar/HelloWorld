# =============================================================================
# RENDER BLUEPRINT - Tells Render how to host your app (infrastructure as code)
# =============================================================================
# When you connect this repo to Render with "New → Blueprint", Render reads
# this file and creates a "Web Service" that builds from your Dockerfile and
# deploys it. Every push to main triggers a new deploy (auto-deploy).
# =============================================================================
# Use "New → Blueprint" in Render (not "Web Service") for Auto-Deploy.
# (Preview Environments require a paid workspace; omitted for Hobby/free tier.)

services:
  - type: web                 # A web service (public URL, HTTP)
    runtime: docker           # Build from the Dockerfile in the repo
    name: hello-world-app     # Name of the service in the Render dashboard
    plan: free                # Use the free tier (Hobby workspace)
    # Render looks for Dockerfile in the repo root by default
